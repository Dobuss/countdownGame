# Countdown Game

This project is a game build with React as part of Udemy course React - The Complete Guide 2023 (incl. React Router & Redux).

## How the game works?

You have 4 sections with 4 different timers. The purpose of the game is to start a timer and stop it as close as posible to 0. The closer you get the more points you earn. If you don't manage to stop the clock in time, you lose and can restart the game.

## What is learnt with this project?

The project focuses on the use of Refs and Portals.
